   <p id="one">Kingsway Christian School actively engages in mission trips to foster a global perspective among students and to serve communities in need. In partnership with Golden Rule Travel, the school ensures that travel arrangements for these trips are both affordable and efficient, allowing participants to focus on their mission work. 

    Kingsway Charities plays a pivotal role in supporting medical missions by distributing donated medications and medical supplies to missionaries serving underdeveloped countries. They collaborate with organizations to equip mission teams with essential resources, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of their outreach efforts. </p> 

<p id="two">Additionally, Kingsway College organizes mission trips to various international destinations. For instance, in January 2025, a group traveled to Santa Elena, Belize, to assist in constructing an eating pavilion for the Billy White SDA school, demonstrating the college's commitment to community service and global engagement. 

    These initiatives reflect Kingsway's dedication to mission work, providing students and participants with opportunities to make a meaningful impact worldwide.</p>
